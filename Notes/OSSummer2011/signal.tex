\section{Signal}\label{sec:signal}

The CMS minimal supergravity low-mass benchmark points
have been designed to cover 
different decay modes of the neutralinos within supersymmetry. 
The mass spectra of the benchmark points have been calculated using the Softsusy code~\cite{softsusy}. 
All branching ratios have been calculated with the SUSYHit program~\cite{susyhit} 
and the events are simulated using Pythia~\cite{pythia}. 
The k-factor for the cross section at 7~TeV is calculated using a modified version of Prospino~2~\cite{prospino}. 
In mSUGRA observable signal is produced strongly followed be (very) long decay chains 
leading to several hard jets (at least two). 
The escaping neutralino leads to missing transverse energy. 
This fact allows to define a search region to observe an excess over the SM 
and is used as main event selection as described in Section~\ref{sec:eventselection}.

Our signal region are defined as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item Two isolated opposite sign same flavour leptons within acceptance of $p_{T,1}>20$~GeV and $p_{T,2}>10$~GeV.
\item The preselection region requires in addtion \HT > 100~GeV, $\MET>100$~GeV
\item The 2010 signal region \HT > 350~GeV, $\MET>150$~GeV
\item We define a high \HT signal region \HT > 600~GeV, $\MET>100$~GeV
\item We define a high \MET signal region \HT > 250~GeV, $\MET>250$~GeV
\end{itemize}

This definition is based on our prejudice of heavy objects
being pair produced decaying subsequently through a cascade
including an opposite sign lepton pair.

%The number of expected events in a given di-lepton channel varies with the mSUGRA point realised by nature. 
%Thus, itsimportance cannot be judged from a single point in mSUGRA phase-space. 
%A range of benchmark points has been studied to anticipate different possible signal constellations and not
%tune towards a specific set of parameters. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:yieldByChannelAndBMPoint} shows the fraction of di-leptonic events splitted by flavour
%for a di-lepton selection on generator level. In all studied benchmark points
%the flavour correlated production dominates over the uncorrelated production.
