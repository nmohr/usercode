\section{Conclusion}

%We have presented a SUSY search for correlated flavour production in the opposite-sign channel
%in the presence of high \HT and \MET.
%We observe good agreement between data and simulation as well as to our background prediction
%method.
%We conclude that there is no sign of flavour correlated production and set a limit $3.0$
%signal events at 95\% confidence level within acceptance of our selection. 
%This excludes the discussed benchmark points LM0.
