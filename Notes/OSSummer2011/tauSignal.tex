\section{Extention to $\tau$ Channels} \label{sec:tauSignal}
So far only the production of light lepton (e, $\mu$) has been discussed. These encompassed both their direct production and
the detection of leptonically decaying $\tau$ leptons. In this section we discuss the inclusion of hadronically decaying
$\tau$ leptons as final states. Thus, three
additional search channels can be defined: e$\tau$, $\mu\tau$ and $\tau\tau$. Note, that as an extention to the light lepton
search these channels are defined strictly exclusive with respect to the light lepton channels.\\
In contrast to the light lepton case, due to the possibility of leptonic $\tau$ decay,  flavor symmetry $\tau$ production
leads to measured final states in all three dilepton channels. This is especially significant due to the large differences in
detection efficiency between hadronic $\tau$ decays and light leptons.\\
For brevity form here on we consider only hadronically decaying $\tau$ as measured $\tau$.
%In some supersymmetric models the mass of the stau is significantly smaller than that of the other charged sleptons.
