\section{Limit}\label{sec:significance}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results}, we see no event 
in the signal region, defined as $H_T>$350~GeV and 
$\MET>150$~GeV and two same flavour opposite sign leptons.

The background prediction from the SM Monte Carlo is 
0.77 $\pm$ 0.26 events, where the uncertainty comes from 
the jet energy scale (30\%, see Section~\ref{sec:systematics}),
the luminosity (11\%), and the lepton/trigger 
efficiency (10\%)\footnote{Other uncertainties associated with 
the modeling of $t\bar{t}$ in MadGraph have not been evaluated.}.
The opposite flavor based background prediction is $0.9 {}_{-0.8}^{+ 2.2}$.

The background prediction is well in agreement with the prediction from
simulation and with the observation of no events.

We calculate a Bayesian 95\% CL upper limit~\cite{bayes} 
on the number of non SM events in this signal region to be 3.0.

We cross-checked the code with a Bayesian 95\% CL upper limit using the MCMC calculator\cite{roostats} 
and get the same result of 3.0.

Here as well, we remind the reader of the number of expected
LM0 and LM1 events from Table~\ref{tab:expect}: $7.3 \pm 1.6$ 
events and $3.3 \pm 0.7$ respectively, where the uncertainties
are from energy scale (Section~\ref{sec:systematics}), luminosity,
and lepton efficiency.

We thus can exclude LM0 95\% confidence level.
