\section{Efficiency for electrons and muons}\label{sec:eff}

The efficiency ratio is derived directly from the data
but selection of an inclusive Z boson sample.
For this we select di-lepton events ($ee$, $\mu\mu$) 
with (20,10) GeV including the lepton trigger paths
listed in Sec.??.

We apply an cut in the invariant mass of $60 < m_{ll} < 120$~GeV
to obtain a pure Z boson sample. The differnt flavour subtraction 
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ofossubtraction} relies on the 
knowledge of the electron to muon efficiency ratio, which
we derive from this sample as
\be
    r_{\mu e} = \sqrt{\frac{n_{\mu\mu}}{n_{ee}}} = 1.13 \pm 0.07
\ee

Since we measure the efficiency on a Z sample, which has a different jet multiplicity
compared to a ttbar sample, we need to assign a systematic uncertainty in the extrapolation.
We test the dependence in simulation by comparing a top MC sample with Z-boson simulation.
While the absolute efficiency drops, the ratio of the electron to muon efficiency
is approximately constant (within $5\%$), meaning that the loss in efficiency is the same for both lepton
flavours. We therefore assume 5\% additional systematic uncertainty on the ratio.
